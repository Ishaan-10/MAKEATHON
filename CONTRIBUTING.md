### Advice for new contributors
Start small. The PRs most likely to be merged are the ones that make small, easily reviewed changes with clear and specific intentions. 

It's a good idea to gauge interest in your intended work by finding the current issue for it or creating a new one yourself.Once you've spent a little bit of time planning your solution, it's a good idea to go back to the issue and talk about your approach. 
### Developer Setup
First, you'll need [Python ](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-391/ "Python version 3.9.1") which matches our current version i.e. 3.9.1. 
Secondly, you'll need [Django](https://pypi.org/project/Django/ "Django").

Then you need git, if you don't have that yet, you can go to: [git](https://git-scm.com/ "git").
