## How to Contribute - Basic 
- Fork The Repository! (extremely important). That basically makes a copy of the same project in your profile.
- Clone the forked repository into your computer.
- Open the cloned repository in an IDE you prefer.

## How to Contribute - The Next Step
- Navigate over to the issues tab in the original repository.
- Comment on the issue thread that you wish to take up.
- The Issue will be assigned on a first request basis.
- A maintainer will assign you the issue.

## How to Contribute - Start Making Changes
- Work in branches! (Extremely Important)
- Make whatever changes you want to on that branch and then create a Pull Request.
- If the PR passes the review from the maintainers and the issue is resolved then your branch will be merged with the main branch.

## Other Important Points
- Write meaningful commit messages.
- Link the concerned issue with the pull request (In the description of your PR write "This fixes #<issue-number>)
- Properly document the tasks you've done in the description of PR.
