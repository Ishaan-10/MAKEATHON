## Dev Environment Details


## How to Submit Changes
1. #### The First Step
  - First things first, fork the MAKEATHON [repository](https://github.com/MicrosoftStudentChapter/MAKEATHON) into your own Github account, and create a local clone of it. This will be used to implement new features and fix bugs.
  - Open this local repository on your personal computer and start implementing.
  - UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCE DON'T WORK DIRECTLY ON THE MASTER BRANCH, but create a separate branch for each issue you are working on. That way you can easily switch between different work, and you can update each one for latest changes on upstream master individually
